# Graph-analysis-on-The-death-on-the-Nile-novel
This project involves :
* Extensive study on centrality of main protagonists i.e. degree, betweenness, closeness, PageRank.
* Calculate the global clustering coefficient of your graph and local clustering coefficient
of the main protagonist nodes.
* Detecting communities.
* Find the degree distribution, average shortest path, size of the largest component.
* Creation of an equivalent generative model to compare against the social graph that we extracted.




### Project guideline followed

* Make a list of characters in the novel. You need to decide whom to include. For
example, for Mahabharata, there is no point in including a character representing
random soldier (;-
* Extract a social graph of the manually identified characters in the text ( as shown in
the hands on session) . For doing this, you need to use a co-occurrence algorithm as
discussed and shown in demo in class
* Calculate the four types of centrality of main protagonists i.e. degree, betweenness,
closeness, PageRank . (Ref : centrality analysis)
* Calculate the global clustering coefficient of your graph and local clustering coefficient
of the main protagonist nodes. Detect communities ( Ref : Measures of
cohesion)
* Find the degree distribution, average shortest path, size of the largest component.
Also create an equivalent generative model to compare against the social graph that
you extracted (Ref : Generative models)




### Theme of the analysis: 
* What you know of the story and is it matching with what you got from
your network analysis ? 
* Have you got any insight to offer ?

### Suggested guidelines:
* Who are the protagonists as per your analysis? If the 4 centrality are not having high
correlation, how do you interpret ?
* What do the clustering coefficients, discovered communities, extracted ego network
of protagonists and average shortest path tell you about the dynamics in the story ?
* You have compared against a generative model (Random graph, Watts and Strogatz,
Preferential Attachment etc.). The parameters from that model and those from your
extracted graph, when compared , tell you what ?
* Feel free to do any appropriate visualization using Gephi only to substantiate your
analysis
